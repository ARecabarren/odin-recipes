        <p>Cream cheese is mixed with herbs and melted in this cream cheese omelet, and it acquires a wonderful taste that you wouldn't associate with cream cheese.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>Â½ cup fresh cilantro leaves </li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>8 large eggs, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1/4 of the butter in a well-seasoned omelet pan or 8-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. When butter is hot and bubbling, swirl it around in the pan.</li>
            <li>Just before butter begins to brown, beat 2 eggs and pour into the pan. Reduce heat.</li>
            <li>After 10 seconds or so, omelet will coagulate. Push omelet to one side of the pan with a spoon or spatula to allow raw egg to flow onto the cleared skillet. Repeat this one more time, then remove the skillet from heat.</li>
            <li>Dab 1/4 of the herbed cream cheese in a line along the middle of omelet. Season with salt and pepper. If omelet has not completely set, place the pan over medium heat for 30 more seconds.</li>
            <li>Slide omelet from the pan onto a plate, so it rolls up, enclosing herbed cream cheese filling. Make 3 more omelets the same way.</li>
        </ol>
